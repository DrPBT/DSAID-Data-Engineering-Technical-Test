# Task 1
It is my 1st time developing using Python, I have tested the data transformation. However I am unsure on how to test the scheduler.

# Task 2
It is also my 1st time using PostgresSQL as well as Docker, i'm unsure if this is the conventional method but I have created a dockerfile which COPY the SQL file attached.
The SQL file contains the SQL scripts to create the tables as per the diagram.
